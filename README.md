# Airdroid
I use and love Airdroid a lot, In my Multiscreen it helps me lot I find it little annoying that I have to start chrome to launch the link to access. So I automated the whole process and made myself a shortcut chrome app. It will be displayed in a separate window.
The offical app is available to windows and is bloated, I am a linux user and I love little tweaks like this on my machine
####Here's how you can use this 
```
* Open Chrome and go to Menu > Tools > Extensions.
* Click Developer mode > Load unpacked extensions...
* Browse to and Select the folder where your manifest.json file is and logo.
* Open a new tab in Chrome to see if your app loads and functions correctly. If not, tweak it and test it until it's working correctly in your browser.(It is working and will be for you also)

```
 You can also search in Unity Search if you're on Ubuntu
 Go here to find your app chrome://apps/



#### This is not a reverse engineered project but just a shortcut to launch the app
