# Airdroid
I use and love Airdroid a lot, In my Multiscreen it helps me lot I find it little annoying that I have to start chrome to launch the link to access. So I automated the whole process and made myself a shortcut chrome app.  
The offical app is available to windows and is bloated, I am a linux user and I love little tweaks like this on my machine


#### This is not a reverse engineered project but just a shortcut to launch the app 
##I AM NOT RELATED TO THE COMPANY AND THIS IS TOTALLY UNOFFICIAL
